# 🌿 Branching Out — User Filtering Tool

**Branching Out** is a lightweight Python program designed to explore and filter user data stored in a `users.json` file.  
Just like branching paths on a tree, the program lets you choose **different filtering routes**:

- 🌱 **Filter by name**  
- 🍃 **Filter by age**  
- 🌿 **Filter by email**

Once a filter is selected, the program loads the data, finds matching users, and displays the results.  
If no user meets the criteria, the program informs you clearly.
